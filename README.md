A minimal test app for live image recognition using ARKit2.

Also check out the [android version](https://github.com/ConSpr/argue-with-ar-android/) of this project.

## Usage
Use plus button to select an image from your gallery or use record button to catch the current frame you see.
You have to label the image and define its physical size.
Now the app detects your image and notifys you.
